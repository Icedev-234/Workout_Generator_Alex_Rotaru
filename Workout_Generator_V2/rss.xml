      <description>The bad blood between the pair has largely played out online but intensified at the Memorial Tournament on Friday when fans were removed from Dublin, Ohio's Muirfield Village for heckling DeChambeau with his rival's nickname "Brooksy."  Koepka, who is not competing this week, said in a video on Twitter that he would offer 50 cases of free beer to any fan whose time was "cut short" at the tournament.  DeChambeau said his agent had spoken to PGA Tour officials without disclosing too many details about the conversation.</description>
